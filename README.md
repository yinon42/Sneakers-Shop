## Installation

1. Clone the repository.
2. Install dependencies if needed (e.g., Firebase via Swift Package Manager).
3. Create a Firebase project at [Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com/).
4. Add an iOS app and download `GoogleService-Info.plist` to the root directory.
5. Enable Firebase Authentication (email/password).
6. Set Firestore database rules appropriately.
7. Run the app via Xcode (iOS 15+ recommended).

## Firestore Collections

- `orders` â€“ stores user order documents with fields like:
  - `userId` (String)
  - `timestamp` (Timestamp)
  - `items` (Array of product objects)
  - `totalPrice` (Double)

## Planned Features

- Apple Pay integration for real purchases.
- User profile with editable info.
- Admin panel for managing product inventory.

## Notes

- Make sure to set up Firestore indexes if needed (Firebase will prompt via error link).
- Images are stored locally via Asset Catalog (not Firebase Storage yet).
- The cart indicator counts total quantities, not unique items.
